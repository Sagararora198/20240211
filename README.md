this repo contain a database which is created using file structure to do CRUD operations and to understand roughly how a database at a low level work

logic---
->Whenever you create and use a database with function it will return a promise so that you don't have to specify which database you want to work on again and again
-> whenever a table is created some unique key is added in the table( i.e file) so it act as database and we can uniquely identify any record in table
-> rest are all the CRUD operations for database,table and record (12 operations)
